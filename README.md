Aim of this project is to test my understanding of how linear regression 
models work. I will attempt to clean, transform and select features appropriately
followed by trying out the two different fit algorithms: Ordinary least Squares
and gradient descent. The data used is a housing dataset for the city of Ames, Iowa from
2006-2010.
